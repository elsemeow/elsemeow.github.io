title: Redesign of My Personal Website
summary: Was built using GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and Tailwind CSS
---

I redesigned my personal website, building it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com){:target="_blank"}, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com){:target="_blank"}. The leaf patterns for the page loading indicator were taken from a previous version of my site.

The second version of the site was published on the `elsemeow.glitch.me` subdomain, created using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org){:target="_blank"} and hosted via [Glitch](https://glitch.com){:target="_blank"}. I [converted "House flying over the island" to SVG](https://codepen.io/elsemeow/full/VwbdvGP){:target="_blank"} format and decided to incorporate leaf patterns into the design.

The first version of the site was published on the `elsemeow.art` domain, created using Vue.js. Concurrently, I drew an illustration titled "House flying over the island", which was later added to the [Spark Collection](https://codepen.io/spark/210){:target="_blank"} on CodePen.
