The artwork for the [Vengeance III](https://starfounder.bandcamp.com/album/vengeance-iii){:target="_blank"} album cover was a 2-day endeavor. The [face](#ai-generated-image) on the cover was generated with AI and refined through the application of diverse filters and shaders. The barcode at the bottom of the cover features the text `ELSEMEOW`. The QR code links to Starfounder's Bandcamp page.

I had to crop and apply various effects to the original image to conceal its imperfections.

## 3 Cover Variations

Starfounder opted for the second option, where I utilized an audio waveform visualization of the initial seconds of the album as the background.
