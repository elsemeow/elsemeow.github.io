A week of sleepless nights has yielded results. I've launched an updated version of my canvas-based game engine with relative scaling â€“ MeowGine. Instead of trying to build my own collision detection for complex objects, I've incorporated Jim Riecken's [SAT.js](https://github.com/jriecken/sat-js){:target="_blank"} as the foundation for the `Entity` class. You can find examples ("Pens") under the [#meowgine-v2](https://codepen.io/tag/meowgine-v2){:target="_blank"} tag on CodePen.

The initial release of MeowGine, launched on October 21, 2021, contains fundamental calculation errors. MeowGine v1.2.0-alpha is no longer in development but remains accessible for use. Older "Pens" used for project testing up to version `v1.2.0-alpha` are available under the [#meowgine](https://codepen.io/tag/meowgine){:target="_blank"} tag on CodePen.

I had planned for the development of the 3rd version to include significant revisions and improvements, but I found it to be unfeasible and have permanently halted the project, along with discontinuing support.
